When entering the app you are introduced to the keypad. you can choose your initial bill amount at the spot. you can also split the bill by up to 99 people. The first 5 are shown upon opening the application. You can then choose the different tip percentages throug the segment control. Default tip percentage is shown by the default key. It can be changed by going into the settings and changing the default tip amount. It can only be changed if you click the save button. After restarting the application by quitting it, you can see that the default tip amount that you entered is saved into the application.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I didn't know how to do a lot of the things I wanted to do beforehand and had to settle with more functionality. I wanted to deselect the tip percentages in the segmented control if I wanted to use the default tip percent. Also, I couldn't figure out how to do animations either which I should have definitely spent more time researching. I also figured out fairly late how to customize the buttons like the stepper and the segmented control and I stil can't figure out how to change to color of the navigation bar. It took me a long time to figure out how to add the % sign to the label in the screen. I googled for a long time and ended up with too complex solutions that I could not figure out and I finally fingured it out through the simplest way possible. It also took a long time for me to understand that I could edit the last price through two different methods. Another simple solution that I spent way too much time overthinking. Also I could not figure out how to implement the commas for numbers over one one thousand and to use the time to erase what was in the text field. Lastly, I could not figure out how to change the default tip amount and, while still in defualt tip amount in the segmented control, autimatically change the bill.
